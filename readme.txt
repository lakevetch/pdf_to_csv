Hi! Thanks for using my pdf converter.

This app has some dependencies. Soon there will be an "installers" script to download the requisite files. For now, to install them follow these steps:
1- Download and install python from python.org
2- Download and install Java and JDK (Java development tools)
3- Open a Terminal, if you haven't done this before, find it in Launchpad
4- Type the following: python3 -m ensurepip
5- The above may have downloaded a tool called "pip" or it may have told you "requirement already satisfied" with the file path to where pip is found. Either way, you're good.
6- Still in Terminal, type the following: pip install tabula-py
7- Downloads will initiate. When they finish, you are ready to go!

To run the app on a Mac, just right-click (or two-fingered click or command-click) the file called "main.py", hover over "Open with", and scroll down to choose "Python Launcher" from the list.

It will open a terminal window. Follow the text prompts to create your csv!

Feel free to try it with the sample.pdf file before you start with your own files.
