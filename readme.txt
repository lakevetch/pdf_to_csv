Hi! Thanks for using my pdf converter.

To install this app on your computer, simply clone this repository into a directory where you want to store it.

If that didn't make sense to you, follow these instructions:

1. Open a terminal. If you haven't done this before, how to do it depends on your system. A quick google to the effect of "terminal [your_os_here]" should get you there.

2. Ensure you have Git installed: 
  - Follow this link: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
  - Find and follow the instructions for your operating system

3. I recommend starting by installing the folder to your Desktop directory, get there by typing into your terminal window:
   cd Desktop
   
4. Type the following:
   git clone https://github.com/lakevetch/pdf_to_csv
   
5. Git will download all of the files from this repository to your Desktop folder.

6. Feel free to drag and drop the folder anywhere you like from here :)


This app has some dependencies. To install them follow these steps:
1- Download and install python from https://www.python.org/downloads/
2- Download and install Java from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk20-linux
3- Open a terminal.
4- Type the following: python3 -m ensurepip
5- The above may have downloaded a tool called "pip" or it may have told you "requirement already satisfied" with the file path to where pip is found. Either way, you're good.
6- Still in Terminal, type the following: pip install tabula-py
7- Downloads will initiate. When they finish, you are ready to go!


To run the app on a Mac, just right-click (or two-fingered click or command-click) the file called "main.py", hover over "Open with", and scroll down to choose "Python Launcher" from the list.
On Windows, if a double-click on the file doesn't run it, do a similar right-click, scroll down to "Open with", find "Python" or similar (sometimes there are version numbers) and choose it to launch.
On Linux, it really depends. I recommend googling for instructions for your specific distro.


Once running, the app will open in a terminal window. Follow the text prompts to create your csv!

Feel free to try it with the sample.pdf file before you start with your own files.
