Hi! Thanks for using my pdf converter.

This app has some dependencies. To install them follow these steps:
1- Download and install python from python.org
2- Download and install Java from https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#jdk20-linux
3- Open a terminal. If you haven't done this before, how to do it depends on your system. A quick google should get you there.
4- Type the following: python3 -m ensurepip
5- The above may have downloaded a tool called "pip" or it may have told you "requirement already satisfied" with the file path to where pip is found. Either way, you're good.
6- Still in Terminal, type the following: pip install tabula-py
7- Downloads will initiate. When they finish, you are ready to go!

To run the app on a Mac, just right-click (or two-fingered click or command-click) the file called "main.py", hover over "Open with", and scroll down to choose "Python Launcher" from the list.
On Windows, if a double-click on the file doesn't run it, do a similar right-click, scroll down, find "Python" or similar (sometimes there are version numbers) and choose it to launch.
On Linux, it really depends. I recommend googling for instructions for your specific distro.

Once running, the app will open in a terminal window. Follow the text prompts to create your csv!

Feel free to try it with the sample.pdf file before you start with your own files.
